            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                In this section I'd describe the things I have learned and why you should consider me as an employer in the company?<br><br>

                First of all Iâ€™d like to mention Diversity.
                I have always defined myself as a multi background person who speaks three languages (Arabic Nativ,English and Dutch) and I believe that these differences make us more richful and inspired.<br> 

                Back to my experience,
                I have gained a lot of sides, starting from how to work under pressure and within a team as well,
                To how to manage the tasks/the schedule I get and more than that how could we achieve the final goal that we all aimed for<br><br>

                Last but not least we all know that we spend more time at the workplace more than any other place, that's why i think a lot about the work environment,
                together we could make this more joyful and connected by merging our hobbies and activities with the whole team<br>
                for example I love jogging and photography and i did a lot of charity running racing to support and connect my community.
                These festivals are a pretty good opportunity to reach a strong team relationship and healthy environment as well.
